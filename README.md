Burials Fork of Adafruit's Python DHT Sensor Library
==================================

This is a Python library to read the DHT series of humidity and temperature sensors on a Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black. This has only been tested and used on a Raspberry Pi 3.

Currently the library is tested with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4. It should work with Python greater than 3.4, too.




Install this in Raspbian using:
---------------------------------

````
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev
````

Install the library by downloading with the download link on the right, unzipping the archive, and executing:

````
sudo python setup.py install
````
